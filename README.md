# computer.art

computer.art is a Chicago creative coding summons, we use [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/computer-dot-art/) to organize our events. Feel free to [sign up](http://eepurl.com/gJpUIH) for our email list.

We're all about creative coding: JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Processing, Java, Python, Ruby, etc. What ever tool, platform, interface, or language you want to use is up to you! If you've never presented, presented a few times, or presented a lot, you're welcome to show what you've created and talk about it. New presenters are highly encouraged to come up and present :D

Review our [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md) prior to attending any events.
