We had our first event for [computer.art](https://www.meetup.com/computer-dot-art) held at [8th Light](https://8thlight.com/), December 10th. I was super excited at everyone that showed interest, supported, attended, and sponsored us :) We took notes, and photos of those who presented, feel free to check out what was shown!

# Artists

### Artist: Hugh Sato

### Project: The Mycelial Project

The project started with parsing data on Twitter for hashtags connected to the Arab Springs to understand the unspoken communication that lead to active role in a democracy. It ends with a method using technology to curate sound and data to choreograph dancers and participants through the generative patterns.

### Artist: Kevin Lesht

### Project: 5 Minutes and a Flip

Summary: Kevin makes an omelet every day, but finds the task of updating his blog tedious. Instead of managing these steps manually he finds an automagical solution! Using DynamoDB, Ruby Lambda, Google Photos, and the homemade Parsley Patch.

### Artist: Arianna Rudawski

### Project: Audio Visualizer

Summary: What is soft? Textures are soft! Arianna explored textures and feelings with sound using openFrameworks. The music shapes the visuals so they react based on auditory data.

### Artist: Dubi Kaufmann

### Project: Penguin Simulator

Summary: Admiral penguins use a unique sound to find their chicks, this project explored that dynamic by asking the audience to text a number. Dubi used Twilio to call participants with a generated audio clip, the goal was to find the other person with the same unique audio clip. So everyone found their partner by seeking their audio partner!

### Artist: Brian Montana

### Project: Processing Video Particles

### Artist: Joe

### Project: Camera Processing

Summary: Joe presented another camera modification using a timing delay on every row of pixels from video data. So the first row of pixels were delayed by the row’s index value in seconds. Next Joe showed off some explorations in TouchDesigner
